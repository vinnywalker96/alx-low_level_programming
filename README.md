This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with ALX Africa Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with Holberton School by th3_gr00t.
All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
C is fun but its not that easy, so I have some notes that will actually show you the journey and thought process.
